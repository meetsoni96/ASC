 The Outdoor Research athlete and ambassador team had big ideas for the next iteration of OR's ski collection; they demanded a bomber, weatherproof jacket and bib pair that enhanced their range of motion while protecting them from the harshest elements on earth. Tall order, indeed - but our designers were up for the challenge. Season after season dedicated to development and relentless testing resulted in this: The Hemispheres Jacket and Bib, featuring trusted GORE-TexÂ® protection infused with unparalleled stretch technology to fulfill all of your powder chasing dreams. Loaded with features, injected with durable materials, and approved (and loved) by the scrupulous OR athlete team, the Hemispheres Collection will revolutionize the way you play in the backcountry.
